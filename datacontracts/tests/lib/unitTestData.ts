This unit's proven robust armaments ensure it maintains control over the battlefield, fortifying positions from above and making short work of grouped targets in the open. </p><p> Originally designed as a deployable manned defensive position, the HA’s adaptation to flight represents a classic North Performance approach to area attack tactics. The Bulwark's journey from a grounded bunker to floating fortress came to fruition long after North Performance's financial collapse. The revival of its design, incorporating turbine technology that was once out of reach, marked a new era in fortified air power. Now capable of flight, the Bulwark serves as a symbol of resurgence and innovation, patrolling the skies as a dynamic force, safeguarding territories with its extensive coverage and floating presence. </p>",

It excels in situations where armor and stability are favored, quickly establishing a high-armor anti-air deterrent with low effort. </p><p>The Crossbow R2 was engineered as a modern solution to an aging defense network on Mars, where its predecessors no longer met the challenges of new warfare dynamics. Built with high armor and large, robust legs, the R2 is uniquely adapted to navigate the rugged Martian mountains, providing stable and effective overwatch across the varied terrains of the Red Planet. By filling the gaps left by older models, the R2 ensures that Mars remains a bastion of safety under the vigilant guard of the Heavy Union.</p>",
